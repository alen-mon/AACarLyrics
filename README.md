## Installation

**Build and Run From Android Studio**

In order to build app APKs:

1. Open the project in Android Studio: File -> Open -> Select this directory and click OK.

2. Select the app directory (e.g. `AppModule/mobile`) in the `Project Structure` UI on the top left. Each sample app has two build targets, one for the `mobile` platform and the other for the `automotive` platform.

3. Go to `Build -> Make Module 'androdix.auto.car.app.AACarLyrics.<sample_app>.<platform>'`. The APKs will be generated in `<sample_app>/<platform>/build/outputs/apk`.

## Initial Setup
In order to install and run the apps:

1. Open the AndroidX project in Android Studio.

2. Go to `Run -> Edit Configurations`, select a sample app target (e.g. `car.app.app-samples.helloworld-mobile`). If you are building for the `mobile` platform, also select `Launch: Nothing` in `General -> Launch Options`. Click OK to close the dialog.

3. Select `Run -> Run <sample_app>`, to run the app, which will just install it in the selected device.
